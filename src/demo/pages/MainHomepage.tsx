            Overall personal objective is to revisit & re-examine the building blocks of user interfaces. For most developers, front-end development starts with a UI framework -Bootstrap, Material Design or other; developers are mostly concerned about functional implementation, so they just need a UI framework that works. 
          </p>
          <p className="homepage-outlined">
            As a designer I have collaborated in a few projects using Bootstrap, lately React-Bootstrap & I have trained myself customizing it. But every designer dreams starting with a clean sheet, and that is just what I am doing here. For now, it’s published as a playground providing a consistent UI to different projects, and presented as an incomplete set of tools that will grow regularly.
